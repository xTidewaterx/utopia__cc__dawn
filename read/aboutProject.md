    API Usage

You can use any Firebase Realtime Database URL as a REST endpoint. All you need to do is append .json to the end of the URL and send a request from your favorite HTTPS client.

HTTPS is required. Firebase only responds to encrypted traffic so that your data remains safe. 

POST - Pushing Data

To accomplish the equivalent of the JavaScript push() method (see Lists of Data), you can issue a POST request.

curl -X POST -d '{"user_id" : "jack", "text" : "Ahoy!"}' \
  'https://[PROJECT_ID].firebaseio.com/message_list.json'

A successful request is indicated by a 200 OK HTTP status code. The response contains the child name of the new data specified in the POST request.
